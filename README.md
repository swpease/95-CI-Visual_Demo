# 95-CI-Visual_Demo
Provides some code to give a visual understanding of the meaning behind 95% confidence intervals


Right now I just have some code that will generate terminal-based output that indicates the number of samplings whose 95% CI's do not encompass the true mean of some manufactured data. I am going to add in a graph, but I have to figure out how to plot in Python, first.
